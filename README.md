git clone https://github.com/mohithkotian/lock-in.git
```
*Or download as ZIP if you prefer the easy route*

### **Step 2: Chrome Extensions Setup**
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in the top-right)
3. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the project folder
4. 🎉 **Lock-In icon should now appear in your extensions bar!**

## 💡 **U S A G E   G U I D E** 📋

2. **Enter** how many minutes you want to focus (1-480 minutes)

### **🏆 Session Complete**
